## Hello Mesh!
2021 November 26. This date marks the beginning of an amazing new project. On this date, our first public Access Point went online. It is a 2.4Ghz Open WiFi network near Jacobs Park. We are excited to get more people to join and expand the coverage of the mesh.

## What's next?
We are really excited to set up our first point-to-point backbone. The planning for this is under way, and should become reality in the near future.
